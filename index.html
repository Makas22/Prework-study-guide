        <h2>HTML</h2>
        <ul>
        <li>The head element contains information about the webpage.</li>
        <li>The body element represents the visible content shown to the user.</li>
        <li>An HTML attribute defines additional information about an element.</li>
        <li>HTML attributes are always defined in the beginning element, never the closing element.</li>
        <li>NTS: Elements almost appear to be like titles and attributes subtitles.</li>
        <li>In semantic HTML elements, the name of the element describes its content and the role it plays on a webpage.</li>
        <li>An element refers to the entire element from opening tag to closing tag, whereas a tag refers only to what appears inside the angle brackets.</li>
        </ul>

      <section class="card" id="css-section">
        <h2>CSS</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>A margin indicates how much space we want around the outside of an element.</li>
          <li>A padding indicates how much space we want around the content inside an element.</li>
          <li>There are three ways to style a webpage using CSS: inline CSS, internal CSS style sheet, and external CSS style sheet.</li>
          <li>A selector defines the element or attributes to which the rules, or declarations, will apply.</li>
          <li>Declarations contain two important components: the CSS property we want to apply and the value of the property. For example, the declaration color: blue; includes the CSS property color and the value for that property, blue.</li>
          <li>When a programmer creates code they can add what is known as a breakpoint. A breakpoint is a point in the program where the code will stop executing.</li>
          <li>Do Not Repeat Yourself (DRY) is a coding principle that encourages developers to reuse or share pieces of code in order to reduce the number of lines of code that need to be written or maintained.</li>

        <h2>Git</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>git status: checks what branch we are currently on</li>
          <li>git checkout -b branch-name: creates a new branch and switches to it</li>
          <li>git checkout followed by branch name allows you to switch branch</li>
          <li>Commit: are the core building block units of a Git project timeline.</li>
          <li>Commits are created with the git commit command to capture the state of a project at that point in time.</li> 
          <li>According to Git, the key to writing effective commit messages is to write them as imperative commands in the present tense.</li>
          <li> It is good practice to have a single convention on a team for consistency.</li>
