# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

Provide a short description explaining the what, why, and how of your project. Use the following questions as a guide:

- Motivation for project was to be able to help provide a place in which bootcamp students could store their notes and have a place to always refer back to. Bootcamps can be overwheling with lots of new information to take in so this was a way for students to learn and store information in which they can easily access. 
- HTML, CSS and Javascipt was what was used to build this project. HTML was used for building the structure, CSS for building on that structure and javascript for adding functionality and better user interaction. 
- The problem of bootcamp students often having so much notes to store and sometimes having notes all muddled up and lost along the way due to the volume, was solved with being able to provide a virtual website in which students can store and easily access their bootcamp notes. 
- What did you learn?
i learnt the basics of HTML, CSS and Javascript. i learnt how to use the terminal to help execute code. I also learnt how to use git and git hub to for commits (saving of work) and version control.
